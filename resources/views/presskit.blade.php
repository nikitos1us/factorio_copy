                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">We are happy that you are interested in featuring the game on your channel / site. This page should help give you some details, information, and assets, that help you make the best content possible. Let us know if there is anything we can help you with.</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white"> You are welcome to use any of the assets, screenshots, and artwork, that you can find on our website. We would recommend checking out our artwork page.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: wheat">Free preview / review keys</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">We are giving free game keys to Youtubers and Press to evaluate the game. If your channel/site has a significant following, then contact us by email for the preview copy.
                            While we do not make the exact requirements known, generally we will only consider active channels that have over 1,000 views on videos published in the last months.r</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">Monetized videos are alright.
                            Please always include link to the game website and possibly further information (information about free demo, price of the game, etc.).
                            Factorio is a slow paced game in the beginning. If you are making a first look / preview video please consider to play the game yourself for some time (couple of hours). That should give you a good overview of what the game is really about (and also some experience :)).</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: wheat">General overview</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies.</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of the Scenario pack, available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor, place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">Factorio was in development from the spring of 2012 to the beginning of 2021. It is our first and so far only game. We deeply care about its quality. That means: Gameplay is the king. No annoying bugs. Optimize for performance. Support and interact with the community. No DRM, pay once, get updates for free.</p>
                        <p class="card-text" style=" color: white">The game runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. Check the free demo or buy the game at our webpage</p>
